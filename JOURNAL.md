### 📅 January 4-5, 2026: Project Foundation
- **Infrastructure Setup:**
  - Installed Ubuntu Linux on VirtualBox (later replaced with Linux Mint due to stability issues)
  - Initial exposure to Bash commands and Linux environment
- **Version Control:**
  - Learned Git fundamentals (init, commit, push)
  - Created and configured first GitHub repository
- **Strategic Planning:**
  - Developed 4-week learning roadmap:
    1. Weeks 1-2: Advanced Python + Telegram bot development
    2. Weeks 3-4: Cybersecurity & cryptography fundamentals
  - Personal goals: Achieve English B2 level, complete Orwell's "1984"
- **Progress:**
  - Registered GitHub account and established workflow
  - Read 2% of adapted English version of "1984"

### ⚙️ January 6, 2026: Environment Optimization
- **System Migration:**
  - Replaced Ubuntu with Linux Mint XFCE (lightweight distribution)
  - Resolved VirtualBox graphical issues by allocating sufficient VRAM (128MB)
- **Development Environment:**
  - Installed Python 3.x, Git, VSCode in Linux Mint
  - Configured SSH keys for GitHub authentication
  - Created virtual environment and initialized project structure
- **Tooling:**
  - Registered on Codewars for coding challenges
  - Created `requirements.txt` with project dependencies
  - Established `.gitignore`
- **Code Management:**
  - Pushed first Python test files to repository
  - Installed `python-telegram-bot` library for upcoming development

### 🗣️ January 7, 2026: English Practice & Planning
- **English Practice:**
  - Conducted conversations with AI bots in English to improve fluency
  - Practiced technical vocabulary through dialogue-based learning
  - Focused on conversational patterns rather than formal study
- **Strategic Adjustment:**
  - Recognized time constraints between coding and language learning
  - Developed micro-plan for sustainable English practice
  - Prioritized quality over quantity in language exposure
- **Technical Planning:**
  - Prepared for next day's focus on Python dictionaries
  - Reviewed resources for systematic learning approach

### 📚 January 8, 2026: Dictionaries Practice & Planning
- **Core Learning:**
  - Studied Python dictionaries through English documentation on 3 websites
  - Understood basic dictionary operations for data storage
- **Code Practice:**
  - Solved 4 Codewars challenges (8 kyu) using dictionaries
  - Created Python files with dictionary implementations
- **Challenges Encountered:**
  - Counter from collections module required deeper understanding
  - HackerRank task on Counter proved difficult due to fatigue
- **Tomorrow's Focus:**
  - Exception handling (try/except blocks)
  - Working with JSON files (dictionary serialization)
  - Applying these concepts to bot configuration

### ⚙️ January 9, 2026: Exceptions, JSON & Testing
- **Core Concepts:**
  - Studied exception handling with `try/except/else/finally` blocks
  - Learned JSON file operations (`json.load()`/`json.dump()`)
  - Understood the purpose of `if __name__ == "__main__"` for testing
- **Practical Implementation:**
  - Completed 4 hands-on tasks integrating exceptions and JSON
  - Developed config loading system with error handling
  - Created reusable functions for file operations
- **English Practice:**
  - Continued technical conversations with AI bots in English
  - Discussed programming concepts and error handling scenarios
- **Progress Assessment:**
  - Task 4 established foundation for future bot configuration system
  - Increased confidence in managing file operations and errors
  - Satisfied with sustainable learning pace and practical focus

### 🧪 January 10, 2026: Config Loader & Structure
- **Project Structure:**
  - Created folder structure for Telegram bot: `handlers/`, `jobs/`, `utils/`
  - Added `__init__.py` files to make Python packages
  - Created `config_template.json` with bot settings
- **Config Loader Development:**
  - Refactored `load_config()` from previous JSON task
  - Implemented logic: config.json → template → default config
- **Testing:**
  - Tested config loading in different scenarios
  - Verified file creation workflow
- **Repository Management:**
  - Updated `.gitignore` for bot config and data
  - Prepared for first bot implementation
- **Next Steps:**
  - Study python-telegram-bot documentation
  - Start bot skeleton (bot.py)
  - Implement "mirror" mode first
